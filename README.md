Assalam U Alaikum, I made this by following <a href="https://youtu.be/3PHXvlpOkf4">this</a> tutorial by <a href="https://github.com/john-smilga">John Smilga</a>.

<h2 align="center">Color Flipper</h2>

<h4>What this project taught me?</h4>
- How to add and use event listeners
<br>
- How to create a random picker (E.G. Name Picker)

<h4>Some tips if you're thinking to make this</h4>
- Always use a <strong>?</strong> before -> <strong>.addEventListener</strong> so that the browser would check if the function exist and then execute it
<br>
- You can copy -> <strong>[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, "A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F"]</strong> as it was damn painful to write it

<h2 align="center">Counter</h2>

<h4>What this project taught me?</h4>
- How to change color while counting
<br>
- How to display content in web using Javascript
<br>
- <strong>textContent</strong> property is similar to <strong>innerHtml</strong>

<h4>Some tips if you're thinking to make this</h4>
- You can style later so just write Html and move on to Javascript
<br>
- It's alright to follow a tutorial line by line but make sure to use what have you learned without peeking
