# javascript-projects-freecodecamp
Assalam U Alaikum, I made this by following <a href="https://youtu.be/3PHXvlpOkf4">this</a> tutorial by <a href="https://github.com/john-smilga">John Smilga</a>.
<hr>
<h4>What this project taught me?</h4>
- How to add and use event listeners
<br>
- How to create a random picker (E.G. Name Picker)
<h4>Some tips if you're thinking to make this</h4>
- Always use a <strong>?</strong> before -> <strong>.addEventListener</strong> so that the browser would check if the function exist and then execute it
<br>
- You can copy -> <strong>[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, "A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F"]</strong> as it was damn painful to write it
